# Brayden's Resume Template
This is the resume template I use, converted into a resume template you can also use. This is heavily based on [NNJR](https://github.com/tzx/NNJR), with the addition of accent colors and a few other minor modifications. This is set-up so that you can use the `template.typ` file as a library, without modification, and then can develop in separate resume files just by importing `template.typ` and adding some boilerplate. The default settings are what I use, but you have can modify the font, font size, font color, accent color, and margins as needed. 

Other than these typst files, you will need to download Font Awesome v4.7.0, which you can find [here.](https://fontawesome.com/v4/get-started/). Scroll down a bit to find the download button, and install the .otf file. Ignore any popups telling you to install v5 or a more recent version, as of right now this code assumes you are using v4.7.0. If you want to use my default settings, you will also need Source Sans 3, which is on [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+3). For whatever reason, installing the variable weight files didn't work for me, so I installed all of the individual files manually. On Windows 11 (and I imagine other platforms as well), if you unzip the folder first, you can simply select all files and hit "Install" in the context menu.
